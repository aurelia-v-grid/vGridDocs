#Aurelia CLI

We will now generate a simple ES6 skeleton to work with CLI and add the grid as a plugin

If you have not installed the CLI then please do so

**How to install :**
`npm install aurelia-cli -g`

---

####Generating the project

Lets now generate a new project, open the cmd/terminal and under your documents and type `au new`
You should have this in you terminal now:

![](/assets/01-new cli project.png)


Type in `vgridSample` in the terminal as project name.
And hit enter key on the next 3 options the CLI ask you about (default choices to generate default ES6 project and install dependencies)

For more info regarding the CLI install etc, see the docs : http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/framework/latest/the-aurelia-cli
