###Simple Column HTML

"Simple column HTML" is where we let the grid do the most of the work for us when it comes to adding css classes/markup. We only add ```<v-grid-col>``` inside the ```<v-grid>``` element with some attributes. Lets look on a small sample to get started.


```html
<v-grid>
  x-attributes
  
  <v-grid-col x-attributes></v-grid-col>
  <v-grid-col x-attributes></v-grid-col>
  <v-grid-col x-attributes></v-grid-col>
  
</v-grid>
```

Next pages will show all the attributes we have, and how/what they do.
