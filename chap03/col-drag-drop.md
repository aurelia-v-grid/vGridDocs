# col-drag-drop (& grouping)


```
//inside vgrid element
<v-grid-col col-drag-drop="title:High;field:high" col-field="high"></v-grid-col>
```

To activate grouping both ```title & field``` needs to be added
Dragdrop between columns is on by default, no need to add any.
To disable dragdrop on 1 column set it to false
```col-drag-drop="false"```
